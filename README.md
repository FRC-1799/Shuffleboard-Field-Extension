# Shuffleboard Field Extension

To run this, run this line in your Visual Studio Code terminal or in the same directory as `settings.gradle`:
`gradlew :example-plugins:PLUGIN-NAME:installPlugin`

This will put the plugin inside of Shuffleboards plugin's folder, allowing the plugin to load next time Shuffleboard boots up.
